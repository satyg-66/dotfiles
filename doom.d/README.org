* ABOUT
This is my personal Emacs config mayed by me and for me. If anyone wants to use it, feel free to do so. However, I will not provide and support and I will not be responsible for anything caused by the config itself.

* CONFIG
Place your private configuration here! Remember, you do not need to run 'doom sync' after modifying this file! Some functionality uses this to identify you, e.g. GPG configuration, email clients, file templates and snippets. It is optional.

#+begin_src elisp
        ;; PERSONAL INFORMATION
(setq user-full-name "Jonas Ingemarsson"
      user-mail-address "ingemarsson.jonas@me.com")
#+end_src


** FONTS
Doom exposes five (optional) variables for controlling fonts in Doom:

 - 'doom-font' -- the primary font to use
 - 'doom-variable-pitch-font' -- a non-monospace font (where applicable)
 - 'doom-big-font' -- used for 'doom-big-font-mode'; use this for presentations or streaming.
 - 'doom-unicode-font' -- for unicode glyphs
 - 'doom-serif-font' -- for the 'fixed-pitch-serif' face

See 'C-h v doom-font' for documentation and more examples of what they accept.

If you or Emacs can't find your font, use 'M-x describe-font' to look them up, `M-x eval-region' to execute elisp code, and 'M-x doom/reload-font' to refresh your font settings. If Emacs still can't find your font, it likely wasn't installed correctly. Font issues are rarely Doom issues!

#+begin_src elisp
        ;; FONTS
(setq doom-font (font-spec :family "JetBrainsMono" :size 13)                                   ;; Make sure to use a font that provides an italic face
      doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "DejaVu Sans" :size 15)
      doom-big-font (font-spec :family "JetBrainsMono" :size 24))                              ;; Enable with SPC t b
(after! doom-themes
  (setq doom-themes-enable-bold t
        doom-themes-enable-italic t))
(custom-set-faces!
  '(font-lock-comment-face :slant italic)
  '(font-lock-keyword-face :slant italic))
#+end_src


** THEMES
There are two ways to load a theme. Both assume the theme is installed and available. You can either set 'doom-theme' or manually load a theme with the 'load-theme' function.
To toggle between different built in themes: 'SPC h t'

#+begin_src elisp
        ;; THEME
(setq doom-theme 'doom-dracula)                                                                ;; Default theme is 'doom-one
#+end_src


** LINE NUMBERS
This determines the style of line numbers in effect. If set to 'nil', line numbers are disabled. For relative line numbers, set this to `relative'.

#+begin_src elisp
        ;; LINE NUMBERS
(setq display-line-numbers-type t)
#+end_src


** PACKAGES
Whenever you reconfigure a package, make sure to wrap your config in an 'after!' block, otherwise Doom's defaults may override your settings. E.g.

(after! PACKAGE
    (setq x y))

The exceptions to this rule:

 - Setting file/directory variables (like `org-directory')
 - Setting variables which explicitly tell you to set them before their package is loaded (see 'C-h v VARIABLE' to look up their documentation).
 - Setting doom variables (which start with 'doom-' or '+').

Here are some additional functions/macros that will help you configure Doom.

 - 'load!' for loading external *.el files relative to this one
 - 'use-package!' for configuring packages
 - 'after!' for running code after a package has loaded
 - 'add-load-path!' for adding directories to the 'load-path', relative to this file. Emacs searches the 'load-path' when you load packages with 'require' or `use-package'.
 - 'map!' for binding new keys

To get information about any of these functions/macros, move the cursor over the highlighted symbol at press 'K' (non-evil users must press 'C-c c k'). This will open documentation for it, including demos of how they are used. Alternatively, use `C-h o' to look up a symbol (functions, variables, faces, etc).

You can also try 'gd' (or 'C-c c d') to jump to their definition and see how they are implemented.

*** ORG-AUTO-TANGLE
Automaticly tangle all snippets within a org document. *#+PROPERTY: header-args :tangle <filename>* and also *#+AUTO_TANGLE t* must be present.

#+begin_src elisp
        ;; ORG-AUTO-TANGLE
(use-package! org-auto-tangle
  :defer t
  :hook (org-mode . org-auto-tangle-mode)
  :config
  (setq org-auto-tangle-default t))
#+end_src

*** ALL THE ICONS
This is an icon set that can be used with dashboard, dired, ibuffer and other Emacs programs.

#+begin_src elisp
        ;; ALL THE ICONS
(use-package all-the-icons)
#+end_src


** STARTUP WINDOW-SIZE
Determens the size of the Emacs window when opened. Default is *maximized*, which means as big as possible without hiding any OS menu bars and such. Toggle *fullscreen* to have a complete fullscreen.

#+begin_src elisp
        ;; EMACS STARTUP WINDOW-SIZE
(add-hook 'window-setup-hook 'toggle-frame-maximized t)                                        ;; uncomment to start maximized
;;(add-hook 'window-setup-hook 'toggle-frame-fullscreen t)                                     ;; uncomment to start fullscreen
#+end_src


** CURSOR LOCATION
This will remember and restore the last curson location of opened files.

#+begin_src elisp
        ;; CURSOR LOCATION
(save-place-mode 1)
#+end_src


** POP-UPS
This will hide all UI dialogs when prompting

#+begin_src elisp
        ;; UI POP-UPS
(setq use-dialog-box nil)
#+end_src


** REVERT BUFFERS
Revert buffers when the underlying file has changes. Also Revert Dired and other buffers.

#+begin_src elisp
        ;; REVERT BUFFERS
(global-auto-revert-mode 1)                                                                    ;; revert buffers when the underlying file has changed
(setq global-auto-revert-non-file-buffers t)                                                   ;; Revert Dired and other buffers
#+end_src


** ORG MODE
Tweaking org mode within Doom Emacs to my liking

#+begin_src elisp
        ;; ORG MODE TWEAKS
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'org-indent-mode)
(setq org-directory "~/org/"                                                                   ;; Setting default org directory
      org-hide-emphasis-markers t)                                                             ;; Hide emphasis-markers
(setq org-src-preserve-indentation nil
      org-src-tab-acts-natively t
      org-edit-src-content-indentation 0)
#+end_src


** HL-TODO-MODE
Enable hl-todo-mode globaly. Hence, this might disable magit-diff highlighting

#+begin_src elisp
        ;; ENABLE HL-TODO-MODE GLOBALY
(define-globalized-minor-mode my-global-hl-todo-mode hl-todo-mode
(lambda () (hl-todo-mode 1)))
(my-global-hl-todo-mode 1)
#+end_src


** DOOM DASHBOARD
Change the default splash image to a custom one. Also remove all links

#+begin_src elisp 
;; (setq fancy-splash-image (concat doom-private-dir "<filename>"))                            ;; uncomment and add path to image
(remove-hook '+doom-dashboard-functions #'doom-dashboard-widget-shortmenu)
#+end_src


** SCROLLING
Emacsâ€™ default scrolling is annoying because of the sudden half-page jumps.  Also, I wanted to adjust the scrolling speed.

#+begin_src elisp
        ;; SCROLLING
(setq scroll-conservatively 101)                                                               ;; value greater than 100 gets rid of half page jumping
(setq mouse-wheel-scroll-amount '(3 ((shift) . 3)))                                            ;; how many lines at a time
(setq mouse-wheel-progressive-speed t)                                                         ;; accelerate scrolling
(setq mouse-wheel-follow-mouse 't)                                                             ;; scroll window under mouse
#+end_src
